## **Detailed Plan to Master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**

### **Phase 1: Strengthen Your Programming Foundation**

Before diving into DSA, it's essential to ensure that your programming skills are solid. Since you already know Java up to collections, we'll focus on reinforcing your understanding of core programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

### **Week 1-2: Core Programming Concepts**

1. **Variables, Data Types, and Operators**
    - Understand primitive data types (`int`, `double`, `char`, `boolean`) and their usage.
    - Learn about operators (`+`, ``, ``, `/`, `%`, etc.) and precedence rules.
    - Practice simple arithmetic and logical operations.
2. **Control Structures**
    - **Conditionals**: `if`, `else if`, `else` statements.
    - **Loops**: `for`, `while`, `do-while`.
    - **Switch-case** statements for multiple conditions.
3. **Functions/Methods**
    - Writing reusable functions.
    - Passing parameters and returning values.
    - Understanding scope and lifetime of variables.
4. **Arrays and Strings**
    - Basic operations: Accessing elements, iterating through arrays.
    - String manipulation: Concatenation, substring, length, etc.
    - Solving problems involving arrays and strings (e.g., reversing a string, finding duplicates in an array).
