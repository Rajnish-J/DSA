## Detailed Notes on Data Structures

### Why Are We Talking About Data Structures?

- Many companies ask questions about data structures and algorithms (DSA) in their interviews.
- There is a lot of hype around DSA because it helps in solving problems efficiently.
- To understand data structures, we first need to understand data.

---

### What Is Data?

- The entire software industry is based on data.
- In Information Technology (IT), the focus is more on information (data) rather than just technology.
- No matter which technology we learn, we mainly learn it to process, store, or analyze data.
- Examples:
    - Programming languages help to process data.
    - Databases help to store data.
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI) helps to generate or understand data.
- Everything is about data!

### What Are Data Structures?

- Data structures are ways to organize and store data efficiently.
- Efficiency means:
    1. Better performance (fast access and modification).
    2. Less memory usage (optimized storage).

---

### Why Do We Need Data Structures?

- Storing data is not enough, we need to store it efficiently.
- If we just dump data randomly, it takes up more memory and becomes harder to search.
- A well-structured way of storing data can:
    1. Improve search speed.
    2. Save memory.
    3. Make applications run faster.
- That is why data structures are very important in software development.

### Relation Between Data Structures and Performance

- Every software application (small or large) requires processing of data.
- Example applications:
    - Calculator â†’ Processes numbers.
    - Banking App â†’ Transfers money.
    - Amazon Website â†’ Searches and processes product details.
- To process data efficiently, we use algorithms.

### What Is an Algorithm?

- An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions to solve a problem.
- Example: Adding two numbers
    - Step 1: Take two numbers from the user.
    - Step 2: Perform addition.
    - Step 3: Show the result.
- These steps are called pseudo code (not specific to any programming language).
- To run on a computer, we write algorithms using a programming language (like Python, Java, etc.).

Example Code (Python) for Adding Two Numbers:

```python
# Step 1: Take input from the user
num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

# Step 2: Perform addition
sum_result = num1 + num2

# Step 3: Show result
print("The sum is:", sum_result)
```

### Why Do Companies Focus on Data Structures?

1. Better Customer Experience
    - A faster application gives users a better experience.
    - Example: If a user searches for a product on Amazon, it should show results instantly.
2. Cost Reduction
    - Large companies (like Meta, Amazon) pay for computations (cloud services, storage, etc.).
    - Optimized algorithms can reduce cost per computation.
    - Example:
        - A bad algorithm may cost $1 per query.
        - An optimized algorithm may reduce it to $0.10 per query.
    - This is why companies hire developers who know DSAâ€”to save money!
3. Hiring and Filtering Candidates
    - Many people apply for software jobs.
    - DSA is used as a way to filter the best candidates.
    - Knowing DSA means:
        - You have strong problem-solving skills.
        - You understand how software systems work.

### Types of Data Structures

- There are many types of data structures.
- Each has specific use cases.
- Some important ones are:
1. Array â†’ Stores data in a fixed-size list.
2. Set â†’ Stores unique elements only.
3. Linked List â†’ Stores data with pointers (not in continuous memory).
4. Tree â†’ Used for hierarchical data (like file system, XML data).
5. Graph â†’ Used for networks, social connections (like Facebook friends).

Example: Array in Python

```python
# Creating an array (list in Python)
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

# Accessing elements
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 10
print(numbers[2])  # Output: 30
```

### Choosing the Right Data Structure

- There is no best data structure.
- It depends on the situation.
- Example:
    - If we need fast searching, we use Set instead of Array.
    - If we need fast insertion/deletion, we use Linked List instead of Array.
    - If we need hierarchical data storage, we use Tree.
- Understanding when to use which data structure is very important.

---

### Conclusion

- Data structures help in storing and processing data efficiently.
- They improve performance and reduce memory usage.
- Companies use DSA to optimize applications and reduce costs.
- Knowing DSA helps in getting software jobs.
- There are many types of data structuresâ€”understanding them helps in building better applications.
