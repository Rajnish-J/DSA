Time complexity:

comparision:

old computer                                    brand new computer
task: find an unavailable                       [same task]
number in the array with the size of 
1 million

time taken: 10 seconds                          time taken: 1 second

* Both machines having the same complexity
conclusion: time complexity != Time taken

comparsion (graph): (command: you can add graph for the comarsion)

old machine                                       new machine


definition: time complexity is a mathematical function, it is a function that tells us how the time is going to grow when the input also growing
            function that gives us the relationship about how the time will grow as the input grows is the time complexity

why we need actually time complexity ?
comparing linear and binary search (command: add graphs for better understanding)
tip: always think about the larger number (what happen when the size goes larger number), don't care about the smaller numbers

comparision: o(1) < o(log N) < o[N]


what do we consider when thinking about the complexity:
    * always look for worst case complexity
    * always look at complexity for large size or data
    * (i): eventhough value of actual time is different they are all growing linearly
      (ii): we dont care about actual time, we actually care about how this time and input growing, this is you we are ignoring all the constants
    * O(N cube + log N) => from point number 2,
        assume that we having an array with 1 million, the time taken respective to the formula is,

        (10,00,000) cube + log(10,00,000) = (10,00,000) cube + 6 seconds [this 6 seconds is very small compared to 1 million cube, so ignore it]
      Always ignore the less dominating terms


Big O notation: the value could not maximize the limit (deals with worst case)

Big (omega) notation : opposite of big O notation (deals with the lowest possiblity of the algorithm)
    * in this case the value could be atleast the expression (it is a lower bound, never below the condition)

question: what if as also having the lower bound and upper bound of N squre
    => o (N square) + big (omega) (N square), we are commonly know as theta function (basicaly combining both)

    O (N square) ->        0       < lim            f(N)    < infinity
                                 n -> infinity      g(N)


little o notation: 
    * this is also giving upper bound
